I use PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization) + MLP（Multilayer Perceptron） to create a RL(Reinforcement Learning) agent to trade stock you provided.
I do not choose to use traditional indiactor to trade stock cause I do think it will lead to the result of strategy homogeneity. 
However, using machine learning methods will face black box problems, which may cause systemic risks.
